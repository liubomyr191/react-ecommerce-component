This is a single project in which a reusable Reaction UI components package and the Reaction Design System website are maintained.
- [`@reactioncommerce/components`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@reactioncommerce/components) (See the package.json in `/package` folder.)
- [Reaction Design System](https://stoic-hodgkin-c0179e.netlify.com/) (See the root package.json.)

We use the [React Styleguidist](https://react-styleguidist.js.org/) package to run and build the Reaction Design System website, and running the style guide locally doubles as an interactive playground for developing and testing the components.

## Use the React components in your project
