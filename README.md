This is a single project with a package of commerce-focused React UI components and the code for the Reaction Design System website:

- [`@reactioncommerce/components`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@reactioncommerce/components): See the [package.json](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction-component-library/blob/master/package/package.json) in [`/package`](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction-component-library/tree/master/package) folder.
- [Reaction Design System](https://designsystem.reactioncommerce.com/): See the root [package.json](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction-component-library/blob/master/package.json).

We use the [React Styleguidist](https://react-styleguidist.js.org/) package to run and build the Reaction Design System website, and running the style guide locally doubles as an interactive playground for developing and testing the components.
